# Homework for Week 3

Please send a zip file to me before the start of next class.

## What we will be working on this week
* Floating with text wrap
* `clear` an element
* "stacking" floats
* Add "clear fix"
* review margin/padding

## Getting Started

Download the starter files

There are two files you will need to edit `index.html` and `css/style.css`.  In each file there are comments that outline what needs to be done.

## Final

You can view the final project in the repo `homework.png`.  This is how it should look when you are all done.
